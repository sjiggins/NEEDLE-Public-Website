    I am a postdoc researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I am part of the CMS
     collaboration at CERN, where my research line is centered around the study of the Higgs
     boson and the reconstruction and calibration of muons. I try to get the best out of the
     available data using machine learning, keeping a tight bond with physics.
